        for non-text elements, such as images. Generally, alternative text exceeding 250 characters,
        which cannot be made more concise without making it less descriptive or meaningful, should
        have a long description. Examples of suitable use of long description are charts, graphs,
        maps, infographics, and other complex images.\n\nLike alternative text, long description
        should be descriptive and meaningful. It should also include all text that is incorporated
        into the image. A long description should provide visually-impaired users with as much
